    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><i>Last Updated: October 21, 2016</i></p>

    <p>ClearedResumes.com is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing resume marketplace
        services on our website.</p>

    <p>Note: Any reference to "we," "us", "our website" or ClearedResumes are references to the www.clearedresumes.com
        site (the "Website"). ClearedResumes provides links to the websites of other companies to which this policy
        does not apply. We cannot, and do not, assume responsibility for the privacy or information policies,
        practices or actions of any third parties.</p>

    <p>ClearedResumes.com is committed to good privacy practices regarding your personally identifiable information.
        Your loyalty as a job seeker, employer customer, or visitor is important, and we hope that our concerns
        regarding your privacy, as described in this policy (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy"), demonstrate our
        commitment to making your experience with ClearedResumes.com enjoyable and satisfying.</p>

    <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at
        support@clearedresumes.com.</p>

    <p>Although we respect the privacy of all those who visit our Website and use our online services, we do collect
        information from our visitors, including job seekers and employer customers. This Privacy Policy governs your
        interaction with the Website and your registration for and use of our online services (collectively, the
        "Services"). Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service Agreement and other
        published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about our members and visitors
        without their permission.</p>

    <h2>Information Gathered</h2>

    <p>We gather two types of information about users:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Non-personally identifiable information (information that does not identify a specific
                individual):</b></p>

            <p>When visitors use the Services, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things,
                which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were "clicked."
                Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, and
                browser software used by each user of the Services. Although such information is not personally
                identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the
                geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>

            <p>The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our
                Website and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose
                some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or
                clicked through their advertisements. We collect non-personally identifiable information in part
                through the use of "cookies", small text files placed on your computer's hard drive, that help us
                determine the type of content and pages to which you link, the length of time you spend at any
                particular area of the Services, and the Services you choose to use.</p>

            <p>Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience with the
                Services. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your
                web browser. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your
                browser.</p>

            <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, and service providers is not covered by our privacy
                policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, and service
                providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, to personalize a user
                experience or in some cases to deliver personalized advertisements.</p>

            <p>This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by this Website. Please be
                aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>

            <p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Personally identifiable information:</b></p>

            <p>In certain areas of the Services, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your resume,
                create a new account, we may request that you provide us with certain personally identifiable
                information, such as your e-mail address, name, profession, or work experience. We will, in such
                situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional.</p>

            <p>Job-seekers should post profiles and resumes on our Website only if they wish such information to be
                viewed by our employer customers. At any time, job-seekers may elect that their profile and resume not
                be searchable by our employer customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their
                resume or, if that is not possible, they may contact us at support@clearedresumes.com and we will make
                the change for them.</p>

            <p>The Services are not available to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

            <p>Please note that we cannot control the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be
                aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a resume or profile or other
                medium, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited email from
                other parties outside ClearedResumes.com. In the event that you encounter any ClearedResumes.com user
                who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact
                support@clearedresumes.com.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Using (and Not Using) Information Gathered</h2>

    <p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Keep in
        mind that, while ClearedResumes.com encourages all third parties involved, including but not limited to its
        advertisers, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and members and to otherwise
        handle personally identifiable information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any
        responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use
        information received either from ClearedResumes.com or independently. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter
        any third party associated with, or who claims association with ClearedResumes.com, who you feel is improperly
        collecting or using information about you, please contact support@clearedresumes.com. We will be happy to
        forward your message to the third party or contact the third party on your behalf.</p>

    <p>How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable
        information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses
        of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and members, and by measuring demographics and
        interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data
        to advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners. We may also use the aggregate data to
        inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their
        sites.</p>

    <p>How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information: We do not sell, re-sell or distribute for
        re-sale your personally identifiable information. Our customers may only use the information provided in
        resumes and profiles of job-seekers to evaluate seekers' qualifications for the customer's open job
        opportunities. Job-seekers should be aware, however, that ClearedResumes.com has no way to control how a
        customer actually uses the service and how they use the resume and profile information. If you believe a
        ClearedResumes.com customer is using personally identifiable information inappropriately, please notify us at
        support@clearedresumes.com.</p>

    <p>Please note that ClearedResumes.com reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any
        visitor or member as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. We may also disclose
        your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal
        process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety
        or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We cooperate with law
        enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities. We
        also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or
        prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing
        activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Service Agreement or other published guidelines.</p>

    <p>If ClearedResumes.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will
        be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your
        personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable
        information. ClearedResumes.com reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third
        party your personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other
        transfer or disposition of any portion or all of ClearedResume.com's or its affiliated entities' assets or
        stock.</p>

    <p>Subject to the foregoing, ClearedResumes.com uses your personally identifying information in several ways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to customize various aspects of the Services to your preferences;</li>
        <li>to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen;</li>
        <li>to send to you ClearedResumes.com solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be
            of interest to you (you may "opt out" of receiving these materials, as provided below);</li>
        <li>to send to you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your use of the Services, such as system status
            updates or order confirmations (because these messages contain important information, you may not be able
            to "opt out" of receiving such messages);</li>
        <li>to send you certain e-mail messages from third party advertisers (you may "opt-out" of receiving these
            materials, as provided below). Such third-party advertisements are distributed by ClearedResumes.com on
            behalf of the advertiser. ClearedResumes.com does not disclose your email address to its advertisers.
            However, you will be interacting directly with the advertiser and will be subject to their privacy policy
            once you "click-through" on an advertisement.</li>
        <li>to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by
            ClearedResumes.com and/or its sponsors (in no case will pre-populating a form automatically transfer any
            data to an advertiser or other third party - only if you voluntarily request that such data be transferred
            will any such transfer take place, e.g., by clicking the "Submit" button);</li>
        <li>and as may be necessary to support the operation of the Services, such as for billing, account maintenance,
            and record-keeping purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the circumstances described above, ClearedResumes.com may disclose your personally-identifiable
        information to third parties as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>When a job-seeker posts a profile or resume on the Website, such information will be shared with our
            employer customers. (Note that at any time, job-seekers may elect that their profile and resume not be
            searchable by our customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their resume or they
            may contact ClearedResumes.com at support@clearedresumes.com and we will make the change for them.)</li>
        <li>When a job-seeker elects to make his or her resume searchable by our customers, the user's name and contact
            information may be displayed to customers performing searches on the site.</li>
        <li>If you "opt in" to receive promotional materials from third parties, information you have made available
            to us may be made available to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of
            interest to you.</li>
        <li>We may provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services to help us with
            our business activities such as processing credit card transaction, offering customer service, or operating
            a community forum. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as
            necessary to provide these services to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Opting Out: You may receive promotional materials from us about ClearedResumes.com Services, or on behalf of
        ClearedResumes.com's affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners. You may "opt out" of receiving such
        materials at any time in a variety of ways: by using the "opt-out" link included in each email, by changing
        your subscriptions preferences on your profile page in your ClearedResumes.com account or by contacting us at
        support@clearedresumes.com. If you have provided more than one email address to our service, you may continue
        to be contacted, unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided. If you opted in to
        receive information directly from third parties, then you must contact those third parties directly to
        opt-out.</p>

    <p>All information made available to ClearedResumes.com may be made available to our contractors and consultants,
        and professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the extent necessary for them to
        perform services on our behalf, and only under a duty of confidentiality.</p>

    <p>Invitations: If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a co-worker to join the site, we will ask you
        for that person's email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting him or her
        to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and
        facilitating the automatic addition of the user account to your company account upon sign-up.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
        information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information
        using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

    <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both
        during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have
        any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at support@clearedresumes.com.</p>

    <h2>Surveys</h2>

    <p>Occasionally, ClearedResumes.com may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and
        to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any
        third party, except in aggregate form.</p>

    <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate,
        we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is
        completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The
        requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
        demographic information (such as zip code). That information, to the extent it conflicts with this policy, will
        govern that particular survey - please remember to read it carefully.</p>

    <p>We may use this information to monitor Website use, to personalize the site, to send participants an email, and
        to measure participants' demographics, interests and opinions. We may use a third party service provider to
        conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally
        identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you
        provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

    <h2>Social Media Features</h2>

    <p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Widgets, that run our site. This Feature may collect your
        IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function
        properly. Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with
        these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

    <h2>Correcting Personal Information</h2>

    <p>If you would like to have your personally identifiable information removed from ClearedResumes.com's database,
        or would like to correct an error in such information, please contact us at support@clearedresumes.com, and we
        will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual
        information that will remain within ClearedResumes.com databases, access logs, and other records, which may or
        may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for
        commercial purposes.</p>

    <p>Access: If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
        correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change on your profile page or by emailing
        our Customer Support at support@clearedresumes.com.</p>

    <p>Data Retention: We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
        you Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide
        you Services, contact us at support@clearedresumes.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary
        to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <p>Testimonials: We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable
        information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their
        name along with their testimonial.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material
        changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a
        notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page
        for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

    <p>Note that, by using the Services, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
        Policy, please do not use the Services. Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes to this Policy
        will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please bookmark this page and review it periodically. If you
        have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, or any other privacy issues in connection with the Services,
        please e-mail us at support@clearedresumes.com.</p>
