        Use (specifically, the "Code of Conduct" section). Additionally, you acknowledge that unauthorized additions,
        deletions and alterations could be made by third parties to the Site. Although the Company attempts to ensure

        listings or other information posted to the Site. Moreover, the Company is not involved in the actual
        transaction, if any, between potential employers and candidates. Consequently, we have no control over the
        quality, safety or legality of the job listings or resumes posted to the Site, the truth or accuracy of such
        job listings or resumes, the ability of employers to hire candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job
        openings.</p>

        and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes. You
        acknowledge that there may be certain risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm and of
        dealing with strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses, associated with pursuing
        relationships begun on the Internet. You assume all risks related to dealing with other users with whom you
        have had contact through the Site.</p>

        job listing or other material you post to the Site. The Company neither warrants nor guarantees that a resume
        or job posting will be viewed by any specific number of users, or that a resume or job listing will be viewed
        by any user. We are not to be considered as an employer with respect to your use of the Site and we shall not
        be responsible for any employment decisions made by any entity posting job listings or resumes to the Site.</p>

        responsible or liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other

        to the site and/or content contained on the site, or any product or service purchased through the site. Your

        site. The sole and exclusive maximum liability to company for all damages, losses, and causes of action

        your use of the Site.</p>

        permission from the Company in writing, it being understood that the Company shall be under no obligation to
        approve any such request. If you are a job-seeker who has reason to believe that your account with us is no
        longer secure, you must promptly change your password by updating your registration information from the
        profile page of the Site and immediately notifying us of the problem via email addressed to
        support@clearedresumes.com. If you are a customer who has reason to believe that your account with us is no
        longer secure, you must promptly contact Customer Support via email addressed to support@clearedresumes.com.
        You are solely and entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and
        solely and entirely responsible for any and all activities that are conducted through your account.</p>

    <h2>Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>

    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe
        that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you have a good
        faith belief that materials hosted by us infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice
        requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following
        information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
        exclusive right that is allegedly being infringed upon; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
        have been infringed upon (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single
        notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be
        infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate
        the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the
        complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material
        in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a
        statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the
        complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
        infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against
        you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current
        statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and
        counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to support@clearedresumes.com. We suggest that you
        consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties
        for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

        the laws of the State of Alabama, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Each party to this Agreement hereby
        submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Marshall County in the State
